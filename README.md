1- Data Preprocessing

How to clean your data, remove NAN's encode dummy variables and deal with categorical variables.  This includes a pre processing template using SK.Learn. 



2- Linear regression

When to use linear regression, using the Linear Regression Class in SK learn and make a predictive model with independent and dependent variable. 


3-Multiple Linear regression
How do you analyze data when you have multiple independent variables influencing the dependent variable. THis section also covers different methods for marking a model such as backward elimination. 


4-Polynomial Regression
How to analyze data when there is a polynomial relation to X and Z. If your dependent variable increases exponentionally , this is your best bet. 

5-Logistic Regression
A form of linear regression, logistic regression finds the best fitting line between two binary options. Based on probability, the built in functions make classifications based on whether the object is closer to one binary choice or the other.
